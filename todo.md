# Things to be done

- [ ] Add tool for building `gcc`, `gdb`, `binutils`, `newlib`, `dtc` and `cppcheck` as it's build right now
- [ ] Extend tool for building additional libraries like `zlib` or `lz4` for all supported architectures by parsing `gcc -print-multi-lib`
- [ ] Add `zlib` or `lz4` to be built into system root
- [ ] Remove `zlib` from newlib
